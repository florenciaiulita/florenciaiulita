I received the Annette Karmiloff-Smith Award for Outstanding PhD Thesis last week.

An immense thank you to the Trisomy 21 Research Society for this recognition to my PhD workâ€¦and my greatest gratitude to my PhD mentor, Dr. A Claudio Cuello, for his guidance, advice and all the incredible learning opportunities I had by his side. 
 
Kudos to Fiorenza Stagni from University of Bologna who also won the same prize!
