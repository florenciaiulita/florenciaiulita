I attended the 28th Symposium on Cerebral Blood Flow, Metabolism and Function in Berlin with my labmate Lin Li and my supervisor Hélène Girouard.
 
It was great to present our results on the impact of arterial stiffness on brain function to such an amazing crowd of vascular scientists. I learnt a lot! Looking forward to the next Brain meeting in 2019!
