I am thrilled to be part of [Women’s Brain Project](http://womensbrainproject.com/), a Swiss-based non-profit organization that advocates for women’s brain health and gender-based scientific research
 
It was great to attend the official launch, which took place at the University of Applied Sciences St Gallen, Switzerland. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KIaQL3r9Lo) to see the Highlights of that day
 
It is an honour to work with this talented and energetic group, and I look forward to the upcoming events!
