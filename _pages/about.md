I am a Senior Postdoctoral Fellow with multidisciplinary training in pharmacology, neuroscience and cerebrovascular physiology
{: .text-justify}

I have specialized on the cognitive and molecular aspects of Alzheimer’s disease and particularly, its development in Down syndrome
{: .text-justify}

I am really curious to understand the long, clinically ‘silent’ phase that precedes dementia. I am particularly intrigued by the role of vascular risk factors in affecting cerebral blood flow and other vital brain processes
{: .text-justify}

My scientific roots were set in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I completed a 5-year research-intensive BSc. program in molecular genetics and biotechnology at Universidad Nacional de Quilmes (2003-2007). I then moved to Canada to pursue my PhD in pharmacology at McGill University, under the direction of Professor A. Claudio Cuello (2009-2014). I am now working at Université de Montréal, under the mentorship of Dr. Hélène Girouard (2015-present)
{: .text-justify}

My greatest aspiration as a scientist is to lead my own team to study the synergistic intersection of the vascular, Alzheimer and Down syndrome fields
{: .text-justify}

Outside the lab, I greatly enjoy travelling and discovering new places. The sea and the great outdoors are my energy sources. I also find fun in learning foreign languages. I am an avid foodie, and for that reason, very happy to live in Montreal where gastronomy is a big part of cultural life!
