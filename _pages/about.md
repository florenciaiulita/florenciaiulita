I am a Postdoctoral Fellow with multidisciplinary training in pharmacology, neuroscience and cerebrovascular physiology.

I have specialized on the cognitive and molecular aspects of Alzheimer’s disease and particularly, its development in Down syndrome.

I am really curious to understand the long, clinically ‘silent’ phase that precedes dementia. My biggest passion is the study of vascular risk factors, and their role in affecting cerebral blood flow and other vital brain processes.

My scientific roots were set in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I completed a 5-year research-intensive BSc. program in molecular genetics and biotechnology at Universidad Nacional de Quilmes. I then moved to Canada to pursue my PhD in pharmacology at McGill University, under the direction of Professor A. Claudio Cuello. I am now working at Université de Montréal, under the mentorship of Dr. Hélène Girouard.

My greatest aspiration as a scientist is to lead my own laboratory to study the synergistic intersection of the vascular, Alzheimer and Down syndrome fields. 
Outside the lab, I greatly enjoy travelling and discovering new places. The sea and the great outdoors are my energy sources. I also find fun in learning foreign languages. I am an avid foodie, and for that reason, very happy to live in Montreal where gastronomy is a big part of cultural life!
