The core of my expertise is the study of Alzheimer’s disease and its development in Down syndrome. During my PhD, my research focused on three main aspects:
{: .text-justify}

* Exploring the mechanisms of cholinergic neuron atrophy in Down syndrome, in relation to nerve growth factor dysmetabolism
{: .text-justify}

* Searching for new biomarkers in cerebro-spinal fluid of Alzheimer’s disease and MCI sufferers
{: .text-justify}

* Examining the early stages of the amyloid pathology and its impact on cognition, using a novel transgenic rat model of Alzheimer’s disease

I then completed a one-year postdoctoral experience with Dr. Cuello where my focus was the investigation of plasma biomarkers in Down syndrome and in the elderly, and their relation to cognitive decline.

For the next phase of my postdoctoral training I decided to venture into a new field to study how vascular risk factors, such as arterial stiffness and hypertension, affect cognition and lead to dementia.

I am working with a new murine model of arterial stiffness, developed by Dr. Girouard, and I am using it to unravel how carotid stiffness disrupts cognitive and cerebrovascular functions.

By understanding disease mechanisms my main objective is to discover new therapeutic targets to protect the brain. I take a multidisciplinary approach to my research, combining in vivo and in vitro methods, and whenever possible I try to translate my results in animal models to human tissue.
